Makefile runs as follows:
'make run' to create executable for function. It will create an executable under the name 'pipe'
Use './pipe' in order to run function

Use this syntax to execute program: ./pipe [directory] [[-s][-S][-t]]
You can exclude or include anything in brackets if you wish.

'make clean' in order to clean up the executable. This will delete the executable and nothing else.

If you are receiving an error on some attempts while entering a directory (ls: invalid option -- ''),
please add "/" to the end of the directory. This will solve the issue.
